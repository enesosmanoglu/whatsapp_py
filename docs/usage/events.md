# Using with events

---

## Import classes
```py
from whatsapp_py import Client, ClientEvents
```

---

## Create client
See [Basic Usage](./basic.md#create-client) for more details.
```py
client = Client()
```

---

## Register event handlers
Decorate functions with `#!python @client.on('event_name')` to register event handlers.

Function name does not matter.

For the `#!python 'event_name'`, use the [`ClientEvents`](/reference/client_events) class.

!!! example

    ```py
    @client.on( ClientEvents.START )
    def on_start():
        print(">> Client started")
    ```

For the list of available events, see [All Client Events](#all-client-events) below.
